There will still need to be people\r\nto address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be\r\naffected by job demand shifts, such as customer service.

Does the system have:\r\na unified interface for ease of management?\r\nautomated machine learning tools for faster model creation with low-code\r\nand no-code functionality?\r\ndecision optimization to streamline the selection and deployment of\r\noptimization models?\r\nvisual modeling to combine visual data science with open-source libraries\r\nand notebook-based interfaces on a unified data and AI studio?\r\nautomated development for beginners to get started quickly and more\r\nadvanced data scientists to experiment?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 19038, "end_char_idx": 21462, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49498cd0-ebfa-4b08-b2b6-472e6a41ece3": {"__data__": {"id_": "49498cd0-ebfa-4b08-b2b6-472e6a41ece3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\shubh\\Desktop\\QA_SYSTEM\\notebook\\..\\Data\\sample.txt", "file_name": "sample.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a3730ad-31cf-4465-9564-ccebe4bc4148", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\shubh\\Desktop\\QA_SYSTEM\\notebook\\..\\Data\\sample.txt", "file_name": "sample.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-16"}, "hash": "ec38ef480b7f13daf6e7adb2efd920a6b2261924853f8abefb697c8123a89424", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "63ffc440-d19e-4061-9de2-563b8aa4a6e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\shubh\\Desktop\\QA_SYSTEM\\notebook\\..\\Data\\sample.txt", "file_name": "sample.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-16"}, "hash": "e86a98626f4f92e25222587f68f27e8f087f1056523050b10fd1789838c76047", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "automated development for beginners to get started quickly and more\r\nadvanced data scientists to experiment?\r\nsynthetic data generator as an alternative or supplement to real-world data\r\nwhen real-world data is not readily available?\r\nGenerative AI capabilities.
